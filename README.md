# Fantactics

A two-player turn-based game, based on a fusion of chess and turn-based strategy video games.

## Set up

To run this program, execute the following commands in the directory containing the game:

### Create the virtual environment and install dependencies (first time only)

Run the setup script the first time the game is being used on a machine.
This command will create a virtual environment under the name '.venv', and will install all dependencies

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Activate Virtual Environment

Next, the virtual environment needs to be activated with the following command

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Start the server (optional)

Next, if playing across different machines on a network, one player must start a server with the following command

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Start the game client

- If no server is running, this command will start the game as single-client hotseat mode
- If a server is running, this command will connect to the server

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Begin

From here, simply select 'Play' on the main menu to begin the game

- If playing with a server, the client will wait for the second player to join to begin
- If not playing with a server, the game will begin immediately

## Game Rules

- When the game begins, two players begin with a set of units on opposing sides of the game board.
- Each turn, a player may select one of their units, and do the following
  - **Move** the unit, and/or
    - **Attack** an adjacent enemy unit
    - Use the unit's **Special Ability** (Effects differ depending on the type of unit in question)
    - Take no action
- Play continues until either:
  - A player's *General* is slain
  - Every one of a player's units, other than their *General* is slain
- Once one of these occurs, that player loses the game!

## Unit Types

Units are divided into the following Unit Types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Each unit has:

- An **HP** stat which represents the amount of damage this unit can take before dying
- An **Attack** stat which represents how much damage this unit deals when attacking
- A **Damage Type**, representing the type of damage this unit's weapon deals
- An **Armour Type**, which effects how much damage this unit takes from different damage types
- A **Movement Range**, which defines how many spaces this unit can move in a turn
- A **Movement Type**, which effects how the unit can move over different types of terrain
- A **Passive Ability** which grants that unit some special bonus
- An **Active Ability** which that unit can use to benefit its player
